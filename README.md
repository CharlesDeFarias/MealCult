# MealCult Express/Crud App
A Node/Express website that provides a series of links to food ordering websites with discount codes to give them free food. Each site is from the mongoDB database and visitors have the ability to upvote or downvote sites. They also have the ability to post a review, stating their experience with a restaurant/site.

## How It's Made:

ES6, EJS, Node and in particular using the express module. CRUD principles utilized.

## Optimizations
I need to figure out how to be able to use a template inside the href tag of an anchor that I put around the span that has the website name. Additionally, I want to make users able to delete reviews they posted even without making an account. Using IP address perhaps? Also want to make it so the site field of the review submission has preset options that don't need to be typed in.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a great practice in using EJS and Node with express
